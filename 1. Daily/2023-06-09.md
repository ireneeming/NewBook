# Moving Backgrounds

We often think of background images as texture or something that provides contrast for legible content - in other words, not really content. If it was content, you'd probably reach for an <img> `<img>` anyway, accessibility and whatnot.

But there are times when the position or scale of a background image might sit somewhere between the poles of content and decoration. Context is king, right? If we change the background image's position, it may convey a bit more context or experience. 

How so? Let's look at a few examples I've seen floating around.

The demo is super practical in lots of ways because it's a neat approach for displaying ads in content. You have the sales pitch and an enticing image to supplement it.

The big limitation for most ads, I'd wager, is the limited real estate. I don't know if you've ever had to drop an ad onto a page, but I have and typically ask the advertiser for an image that meets exact pixel dimensions, so the asset fits the space.

But Chris's demo alleviates the space issue. Hover the image and watch it both move and scale. The user actually gets more context for the product than they would have when the image was in its original position.That’s a win-win, right? The advertiser gets to create an eye-catching image without compromising context. Meanwhile, the user gets a little extra value from the newly revealed portions of the image.

If you peek at the demo’s markup, you’ll notice it’s pretty much what you’d expect. Here’s an abridged version:

```
<div class="ad-container">
	<a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
		<!-- Background image container -->
		<div class="ad-image"></div>
	</a> 
	<div class="ad-content"> 
		<!-- Content --> 
	</div> 
</div>
```

We could probably quibble over the semantics a bit, but that’s not the point. We have a container with a linked-up `<div>` for the background image and another `<div>` to hold the content.

As far as styling goes, the important pieces are here:

```
.container { 
	background-image: url("/path/to/some/image.png"); 
	background-repeat: no-repeat; 
	background-position: 0 0; 
	height: 400px; 
	width: 350px; 
}
```

Not bad, right? We give the container some dimensions and set a background image on it that doesn’t repeat and is positioned by its bottom-left edge.

The real trick is with JavaScript. We will use that to get the mouse position and the container’s offset, then convert that value to an appropriate scale to set the `background-position`. First, let’s listen for mouse movements on the `.container` element:

```
let container = document.querySelector(".container"); 

container.addEventListener("mousemove", function(e) { 
	// Our function 
	} 
);
```

From here, we can use the container’s `offsetX` and `offsetY` properties. But we won’t use these values directly, as the value for the X coordinate is smaller than what we need, and the Y coordinate is larger. We will have to play around a bit to find a constant that we can use as a multiplier.

It’s a bit touch-and-feel, but I’ve found that `1.32` and `0.455` work perfectly for the X and Y coordinates, respectively. We multiply the offsets by those values, append a `px` unit on the result, then apply it to the `background-position` values.

```
let container = document.querySelector(".container"); container.addEventListener("mousemove", function(e) { 
	container.style.backgroundPositionX = -e.offsetX * 1.32 + "px";
	container.style.backgroundPositionY = -e.offsetY * 0.455 + "px";
	} 
);
```
Lastly, we can also reset the background positions back to the original if the user leaves the image container.

```
container.addEventListener("mouseleave", function() {
    container.style.backgroundPosition = "0px 0px";
  }
);
```

Since we're on CSS-Tricks, I'll offer that we could have done a much cheaper version of this with a little hover transition in vanilla CSS:
